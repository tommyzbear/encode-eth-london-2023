# Avatar Wallet
Avatar Wallet is a robust digital wallet solution that incorporates account abstraction technology to enhance user experience and security. At its core, Avatar Wallet is designed to simplify cryptocurrency management, while also offering a unique interface through which users can create personal avatars. The avatars serve as a personalized gateway to monitor crypto holdings, store Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and engage in token swaps.

# Features
Smart Wallet
Harnessing account abstraction, we've crafted a smart wallet that seamlessly blends backend operations with a user-friendly frontend. This allows for intuitive management and tracking of cryptocurrency assets.

# Personalized Avatars
Create and customize avatars that represent your digital identity within the wallet. Your avatar not only makes your wallet interaction enjoyable but also provides a visual summary of your crypto holdings and NFT collection.

# NFT Storage and Token Swapping
Our wallet caters to modern-day crypto enthusiasts by supporting NFT storage and enabling smooth token swaps, thus enhancing asset liquidity and exploration.

# Social Recovery Mechanism
Losing access to a wallet can be a harrowing experience. Avatar Wallet's social recovery feature mitigates this risk. In the event of a lost key, a user can recover their wallet by obtaining signatures from at least two designated guardians. This multi-signature process ensures secure and hassle-free account recovery.
